        This is a great meal to serve to friends or eat alone. It can take up to 15-20 mins. I enjoy cooking this meal when I need something quick and easy for dinner, there is always going to be some left overs as this is a filling meal. If you are looking to take more to this recipe, I suggest adding more vegetables like green bell pepper and mushrooms and topping it with parmesan cheese.

    I normally make this meal during Lent when I cannot eat meat and still want to enjoy cooking a meal without meat. This makes my cheap 32 cent macaroni into more of a meal that is enjoyable. This whole meal can cost up to 2 dollars which is one of the cheapest meals I make. An alternative to this would be making Pico de Gallo and refrigerating it then adding it to the macaroni and cheese when it is time.

    I enjoy cooking this meal when I am trying to be healthy. This is a great alternative for normal tacos, it is less carbs and instead of rice or with rice you can add beans to this meal to make your taco fuller. This meal is great for those who are trying to lose weight but do not want to give up the foods they eat. There are different toppings that can be added to this recipe and would still make it healthy like, corn, tomatoes, and avocado. This is healthy eating done right.

     I enjoy eating this dish for breakfast and sometimes a quick lunch. This is a simple and quick meal to make, it is also filling. Sometimes when I have more time I will add a side of hashbrowns to this meal or some green bell pepper and onion to complete this meal.
