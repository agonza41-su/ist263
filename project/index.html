        <h2>About Myself and The Website</h2>
        <p>
        
            My name is <strong>Anya Gonzalez</strong>, and I currently am a junior attending Syracuse University. I am majoring in Policy Studies within Business and Government and minoring in Information Management and Technology. I am also a former Division 1 student-athlete here at Syracuse University.   I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. I am in a family of 6, two older sisters, Ariana, and Alana, and one younger brother, Frankie. When growing up with a big family, going out to eat at a restaurant was not always an option. It probably happened once a week or once every two weeks. My mother normally was the one to cook meals for the family. These meals were normally traditional dishes and sometimes they were dishes that my mother had made with whatever we had in our house. These kinds of meals were always fun because they were not what was normally prepared for dinner. At the age of 8, I started watching my mom cook in the kitchen and would observe how she would cut, season, and prepare dinner.  Eventually, my mother started having me cook with her. I started off with small tasks like beating eggs and gradually made my way to making a whole meal on my own. Cooking has been a part of my life; I enjoy trying new foods and attempted to prepare them on my own. 
            <br>
            As a college student, I have met a range of people from Arizona to New York. I realize that not many people have ever had to really cook for themselves. After speaking with friends and roommates, I realized that a lot of people had their parents cook them meals while they were at home.  I have also had roommates and friends that went out to eat for meals once they got to college because they didn’t know how to cook anything other than a simple meal, let alone season food. If they were not eating out, the option for them was normally to warm up ramen or a canned item. As I live on my own, I have been cooking on a budget and trying to stay healthy.  When being on a budget, it can be hard to also be healthy. I decide to share some simple meals that you can make and add a little sparkle to. I’ve learned that you can make simple meals and turn it into a unique meal by add a little something to it. 
            <br>
            On this website you will find a cheap, and easy meals and desserts to make that will get you through college. These recipes range from healthy meals or meals that are just quick and easy. As I have a cat that loves to eat dinner with me, I have included some ideas and suggestions for dinners to feed your cat.
